Replace words with translations you've learnt while browsing the web

This extension is not live.

This extension was designed to work with AnkiConnect. The idea is that you load one of your Anki decks onto the extension, and for every word that you've learnt in review it would replace words on the current page's HTML with the foreign word.

Added some terrible styling just for completeness but this idea won't be looked at again. Replacing words without context is probably not a good way of learning a new language (I've been told it's terrible).
